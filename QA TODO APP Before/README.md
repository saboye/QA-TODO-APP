7. Compare the results to verify that the app's functionality is consistent across different web browsers.

This test case can be repeated as needed to verify that the app's functionality is consistent across other web browsers as well. The specific steps will depend on the app's requirements and functionality.

### 4. verifying that tasks can be added and displayed correctly in the app:

1. Open the app in a web browser.
2. Enter a task name in the input field (e.g. "Test task 1").
3. Click the "Add" button.
4. Verify that the task appears in the task list.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 to add additional tasks.
6. Verify that all tasks appear in the task list as expected.

This test case can be repeated as needed to verify that tasks can be added and displayed correctly in the app.

### 5. verifying that tasks can be marked as complete:

1. Open the app in a web browser.
2. Add a task to the task list.
3. Click the checkbox next to the task to mark it as complete.
4. Verify that the task is struck through and has a "Completed" label.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 to mark additional tasks as complete.

This test case can be repeated as needed to verify that tasks can be marked as complete.

### 6. verifying that tasks can be deleted:

2. Add a task to the task list.
3. Click the delete button next to the task.
4. Verify that the task is removed from the task list.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 to delete additional tasks.

This test case can be repeated as needed to verify that tasks can be deleted.

### 7. Verifying that tasks are persisted in browser storage:

1. Open the app in a web browser.
2. Add a task to the task list.
3. Refresh the page.
4. Verify that the task is still present in the task list.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 to add and refresh multiple tasks.
6. Verify that all tasks are persisted in the browser storage as expected.

This test case can be repeated as needed to verify that tasks are persisted in browser storage

 ### 8. verifying that a timestamp is added to each task when it is created:

1. Open the app in a web browser.
2. Add a task to the task list.
3. Verify that a timestamp is displayed next to the task.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 to add and verify timestamps for additional tasks.

This test case can be repeated as needed to verify that timestamps are added to tasks as expected.

### 9. verifying that the app's search functionality works as expected:

1. Open the app in a web browser.
2. Add multiple tasks to the task list.
3. Enter a search term in the search field (e.g. the name of one of the tasks).
4. Verify that only the tasks that match the search term are displayed in the task list.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 with different search terms to verify that the search functionality works as expected.

This test case can be repeated as needed to verify that the app's search functionality is working correctly.


#### 10. verifying that the app's sorting functionality works as expected:

1. Open the app in a web browser.
2. Add multiple tasks to the task list.
